I am a senior undergraduate in School of Mathematical Sciences at Peking University (PKU), majoring in Information and Data Science. My advisor is Prof. Zhanxing Zhu. I am interested in deep learning, especially in representation learning and adversarial robustness.

I will start my PhD degree next year in School of Mathematical Sciences at Peking University.
